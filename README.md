<h1>Repository: Front End Collection</h1>

Description:
The Front End Collection repository is a compilation of my front-end projects built using HTML and CSS. This collection showcases various interactive and visually appealing web components and applications.

Projects:

1. Account Creation Form:
   a set of beautifully designed account creation form. This form provides a seamless user experience, allowing users to input their information.

2. Plan Viewer:
   Dive into the Plan Viewer project, which provides an interface to view different payment plans.

3. Main Page:
   The Main Page project presents an aesthetically pleasing landing page.
   
5. Calculator:
   a beautifully designed calculator using css grid that sadly can't calculate anything but it can get user input and show them.

Feel free to explore the projects, examine the code, and even use them as a foundation for your own creations and let your imagination run wild!
